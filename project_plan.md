Make sure your presentation is crystal clear to anyone and everyone. Here is a template you can use, but you don't have to follow it strictly â€“ you choose the best way to introduce your project outcome.

Problem

Tell us a story that addresses the problem your product or service solves. Avoid using buzzwords and tech talk when you tell your story. Keep it simple and realistic.

Solution

donator is an application which lets users find nearby interesting locations and/or brick-and-mortar-businesses, visit these places and gather donations to charities by checking-in there.
The check-in generates a donation from the business to a charity and additionally displays a message to the user from the business. The user can then add to that donation from their own account.
Businesses may choose any locations from which check-ins generate a donation, instead of choosing the office building they might choose a landmark in the city.
Organisation can create donation tracks, which involve multiple locations and when a user follows the track the regular donations would be increased by a multiplier.
This way cities could create tourism tracks to show off their most beautiful spots and generate donations for charities.
Monthly leaderboards keep track of people who gathered the most donations and businesses with the most activity, which leads to users competing to get higher amounts of donations gathered.

<!-- - Businesses get good PR value from donating to charities
- Businesses get new customers and more revenue from people visiting their stores -->

Business model

Why it is better than competitors/why it is unique?
How your idea will (or does) convert into being economically viable. What do you sell? To whom?

This is a non-profit work. If we need some money for running this, we can take
little cut from donations.

Technology & Product

Which tech/API's were used with it and how?

We decided to use Elixir at our backend. For database we used MongoDB. With this
combination we expect to get best ability for scaling. We use Facebook, Twitter,
Google and GtiHub APIs for authentication. Foursquare APIs we used for
locations.
