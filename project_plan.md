Make sure your presentation is crystal clear to anyone and everyone. Here is a template you can use, but you don't have to follow it strictly â€“ you choose the best way to introduce your project outcome.

Problem

Tell us a story that addresses the problem your product or service solves. Avoid using buzzwords and tech talk when you tell your story. Keep it simple and realistic.

Solution

Describe your software. What can be done with it?

Business model

Why it is better than competitors/why it is unique?
How your idea will (or does) convert into being economically viable. What do you sell? To whom?

This is a non-profit work. If we need some money for running this, we can take
little cut from donations.

Improvements

Which improvements were done during Ultrahack?
What are planned improvements after Ultrahack?
Did you/how did you pivoted during the Ultrahack?

Technology & Product

Which tech/API's were used with it and how?

We decided to use Elixir at our backend. For database we used MongoDB. With this
combination we expect to get best ability for scaling. We use Facebook, Twitter,
Google and GtiHub APIs for authentication. Foursquare APIs we used for
locations.

How did you benefit from Ultrahack-coaching or new talent recruits during Ultrahack?

Background

Introduce your team and your teams' background.
