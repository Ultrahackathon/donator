### Problem

Brick-and-mortar stores are lacking visitors as more and more business is handled online. These stores are part of the city's identity, and we don't want them to die. Cities have a lot of other interesting places (POI), but are very poor at marketing and promoting, especially in digital channels. The general problem for users is lack of knowledge POI's existence and motivation to actually visit them in first place.


### Solution

Our service connects users (customers) and business who has similar interests towards charity. Service allows business to attract visitors by promising a donation to charity. For this to happen, user must visit physically a location defined by business. 

Donator is an application which lets users find nearby interesting locations and brick-and-mortar businesses. Application user may visit these places and gather donations to charities by checking-in in the location. This check-in generates a pre-defined donation from the business to a charity and additionally displays a message to the user. The user can then contribute to that donation if they wish.

Businesses may choose any locations from which check-ins generate a donation, instead of choosing the office building they might choose a landmark in the city.
Application supports creating a donation track, which involve multiple locations where user subsequently check-ins in a predefined route. Completing the route would increase the regular donation by a multiplier. This allows for example cities and municipalities to create tourism tracks to show off their most beautiful spots and generate donations for charities.

Monthly leaderboards keep track of people who gathered the most donations and businesses with the most activity, which leads to users competing to get higher amounts of donations gathered.

### Business model

- Why it is better than competitors/why it is unique?
- How your idea will (or does) convert into being economically viable. What do you sell? To whom?

This is a non-profit work. If we need some money for running this, we can take
little cut from donations.

### Technology & Product

We're creating a mobile application which is built with React and PhoneGap.
This application has an Elixir backend with MongoDB as our data storage solution.
With this combination we are looking at the best ability for scaling to the applications needs.
We use Facebook, Twitter, Google and GitHub APIs for authentication of users.
Foursquare APIs are used for locations and check-ins.
